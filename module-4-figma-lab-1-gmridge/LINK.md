Concept: 
a social media designed for people with Endometriosis and associated diseases.
A place where you can build community, receive support and share information with others going through similar experiences.
Designed to help by being able to review local doctors to ensure less medical gaslighting and a place to track foods that increase inflammation or that are safe to eat when not feeling your best.

Research:
- 1 in 10 will have endometriosis. 176 million worldwide.
- on average it takes 8 years to receive a diagnosis
- there is no cure
- 50% of people with endometriosis contemplate suicide.
- there is little research into the condition/women's health.
- only since 1993 were women legally required to be a part of drug trials and other clinical research.
